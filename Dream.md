Patent thoughts are transformed into manifest thoughts. Dreams hide disturbing Signifiers. Affects cannot be repressed, and are present in dreams.
# Processes
## Condensation
[[Lacantian Mathematics#Metaphor|Metaphoric]]
Creating a new idea of thing by combining ideas of other things.
In dreams, the unconscious combines many Signifiers creating surreal results.
### Example
A young woman dreams she is looking into a big chest full of clothes and strange objects. She finds what looks like the skin of a monkey, but realizes that it is actually still alive. She experiences a sudden outburst of violence and crushes one of the animal's feet with her bare hands. She can feel the bones cracking.

During the session, this patient described how she crushed the monkey's foot and tried unsuccessfully to remember a scene in her life in which a monkey or a foot were involved. When asked to go through the description again, she says, "I can feel his foot being broken in my grip. The crushing of his toes. His tootsies," and suddenly remembers that "tootsie" was the childhood nickname of her older sister with whom she had a relationship of intense rivalry.
- [[Lacantian Mathematics#Metaphor|metaphor]]: "Tootsie" is toe
- [[Lacantian Mathematics#Synecdoche|synecdoche]]: toe is part of foot
- associative signifier chain: patient is crushing Tootsie.

### Example
A young woman has talked to her analyst for some time about her difficult relationship with her parents. Her mother is severely obsessional and her father used his daughter as a confidant, telling her in particular, inappropriate details about his sexual life. She left home as soon as she could and has avoided contact with her parents for many years. This is the dream she told during a session three days after a holiday during which she saw her father but failed to talk to him...

>There was this man who wanted to kill me. I knew it. I was hiding behind a bush with two children. A boy and a girl. Trying to protect them. I went to hide in a building. It was a library. People were lying on the floor. Lots of people. Like as if they were sleeping. I tried to hide in the middle of them. I wanted to melt within all the bodies. The children were gone.
>The many went into the library and, without difficulty, he found me. I was not scared, even though I knew he wanted to kill me. So I stood up and stabbed him with a pen. I felt the pen entering his chest and there was blood everywhere. He was in pain and the situation looked terrible, but I felt relieved. The people around me did not react at all, as though all this was normal. Expected.

| Dream               | Life                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| hiding in a library | reading books                     |
| hiding in bodies    | sexually promiscuous              |
| stab with pen       | venting anger with written letter |
| terrible situation  | relief from letter                |
| normal              | sending a letter                  |
# Symbolic Replacement
The unconscious may substitute whole signifiers or parts.
### Example
A Jewish woman is living in London...
>There was this really annoying spider. I am afraid of spiders, but this one was more annoying than scary. It just kept bothering me. And, somehow, I had to be nice to it. I couldn't just squash it. I had to talk to it. But it kept getting in my face and annoying me. It looked, well, not much like a spider. More like a little, ball of fluff with a dark center, and, sort of, light, woolly hair coming off of it.

...she is describing the same feelings she has towards a neighbor she suspects is having an affair with her husband, described as...
- light-weight
- an air head
- racist
- would-be Nazi sympathizer
