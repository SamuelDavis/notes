[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] was attempting to restore Freud's idea of subjectivity to psychiatry.

The Ego is what one says of oneself. The Subject is the unrecognized self which is speaking.

The Ego is a fantasy, constructed by the Subject to identify itself, which an individual must reconcile with reality.

All thought originates in the Subject, but any thinking manifests the Ego, obscuring the Subject.

The Ego is not based on reality, but comprised of...
- active denial of reality (It's not so bad).
- active denial of the Subject (I'm not scared).
- wishful thinking about reality or the Subject (I can do this).

Anything coming from the Ego is inherently false (even though it might circumstantially or accidentally be correct) because it is itself a lie.

The Ego acts as a defense mechanism against the unsurvivable reality; a father indulges the development of the Ego, letting a child win a race because the fantasy of a winner is better than the anxiety of being an incompetent.

### Conflicting
- Daniel Stern – "The Interpersonal World of the Infant" (1985)
	- Emphasizes the infant's experience of self as emerging through interactions with caregivers.
	- Describes the "core self" as arising from patterns of affect, intention, and movement.
	- Rejects the idea of the self as illusion—infants gradually build a relational and coherent sense of being.


## Origin

Gaze refers to how an external entity perceives and interacts with oneself.

Prior to [[The Mirror Stage]] the child's identity is revealed through it's relationship with its mother, inferring things about itself from it's mother's Gaze.

Eventually the child sees its reflection in the mirror. The reflection is interpreted as a separate entity which represents itself. This is often reinforced by the mother who speaks objectively about the reflection ("Who is that? That's `name`!").

Thus it creates an Ego, or fanciful facade it can recognize in place of its unrecognizable Subject.

The Mother's Gaze plays a critical role in the foundations of the Ego. Failure to found the ego in a consistent, positive Gaze can cripple development.
## Autism

If the Subject is not firmly cemented during [[The Mirror Stage]], autistic symptoms can manifest. Communication must be directed from a Subject to a Subject. When a child has no Subject, then they may be able to use words, but not [[Communitcation|communicate]].
## Misc

The Subject consists of the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and the Real

The Subject is primal and unrecognizable, read: chaotic, it imagines the Ego to create an illusion of coherence.
	Alan Watt's Zen is about trying to destroy the Ego and get back to the primal, disorganized Subject?

After realizing the idealized self in the mirror.
Coincides with the acquisition of language.

The baby sees it's reflection as a separate entity, and a representation of itself, and then associates with that image rather than itself. 

Children sometimes use the objective "me", the third person, or entirely avoid pronouns, before eventually using the subjective "I" because they associate with the Ego rather than the Self.
