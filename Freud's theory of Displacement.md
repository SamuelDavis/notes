Displacement occurs when a Signifier unrelated to the affect becomes confused with the now repressed origin of the affect. It is incidental. Contiguity is associative.

This process is controlled by Signifier chains in the unconscious. By following the Signifiers chain, the original Signifier and thus the cause of the affect can be identified.

> An anorexic girl may say, "I just want to be thin," but in her unconscious, "thin" is the end of a long associative chain... It is by bringing into conscious speech the links of this chain that the patient can move further and further towards the core of his or her Subject.
> -- *Lacan*, Lionel Bailly

Or, for example, a dreamer may be dreaming of a funeral and yet feel joy because the happy affect has been displaced from some obscured Signifier onto this loosely associated one.
