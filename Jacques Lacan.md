# Linguistics and Structuralism
## Linguistics
[[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s looking at cultures in their own context
- signified: what is referred to
- signifier: what is identifiable about the signified

Meaning is encoded in the speech of the analysand
In the subject's unconscious, the relationship of words is more important than words to objects
The unconscious is structured like a language (not by language).
The meaning of dreams is structured like a language, meaning the way people speak about them gives informs their meaning

[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' interrogating how the mores of culture reinforce each other

Lacan took Structuralism and theorized
language, culture, and individuals are a code of meaning
