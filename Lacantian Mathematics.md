# Example

S<sub>1</sub> = "Person"
*s*<sub>1</sub> = person

S<sub>2</sub> = "Star"
*s*<sub>2</sub> = brilliance, rank

*s*<sub>3</sub> = *s*<sub>2</sub> + *s*<sub>1</sub> - S<sub>2</sub>

>A star is born.
>A S<sub>2</sub> / *s*<sub>1</sub> is born.

# Explanation

By "crossing the bar," a person takes the Signified *s*<sub>1</sub>, infers the true Signifier S<sub>1</sub>, combines it with the metaphorical Signified s<sub>2</sub>,  and creates the new Signifier S<sub>3</sub>, which more accurately evokes the intended Signified, *s*<sub>3</sub>, then deletes the metaphorical Signifier S<sub>2</sub> as no longer useful and potentially confusing.

# Metaphor

In psychosis, the subject is unable to perform Lacantian Mathematics, either because they...
- *select* inappropriate or repressed Signifiers, (recognizing the metaphor but causing confusion and anxiety).
- are unable to perform *substitution*, (not recognizing the metaphor and causing bafflement).

## Metonymy
