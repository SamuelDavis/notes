Master Signifiers twist signifier chains to mean the opposite of what is being signified in order to repress painful signified and preserve the ego, e.g. [[sour grapes]].
- apparently illogical having no association with circumstance or apparent Signified
- repeated often in different contexts
- having unconscious, subjective Signifieds, often the inverse

## Example

An 11-year-old girl had been bullying another in her class. The teachers were concerned that her behavior was linked with the death, the previous year, of her father. After a few sessions, the psychologist noticed that she used the word "Lucky" a lot. Often in ways that made little sense, or in contexts that were fairly uninteresting or inappropriate.

>I'm so lucky because I haven't got to go to the hairdresser's.
>There were five purple bracelets and four pink ones and I'm so lucky I got one of the purple ones.

The focus of the bullying was accepted into a private school the bully had wanted to attend but could not afford. When obliquely mentioning the school, she said...

>I'm so lucky, you know why? I haven't got to take the entrance exam.

"I haven't got to take the entrance exam," might be too painful to express, so "I'm so lucky," orients the chain to preserve her ego.
