# Origin

From birth, babies are not just drives; they are already "thinking" about concepts:
- Comfort / Discomfort
- Presence/ Absence
Infants immediately start creating [[Linguistics#definitions|proto-Signifieds]].
	Babies laugh at balloons bouncing on the ceiling because they already understand the Signified gravity which is being subverted.

Eventually, once the baby has Signifiers (this, language), there will come a time when it has an unbearable thought. When this happens, it will repress the Signifier, creating the unconscious.

# Definition

The unconscious is a collection of repressed Signifiers.

Usually, it's a particular chain of Signifiers. This means any particular Signifier is still accessible in other contexts.

"Foreclosure" is the process of completely repressing a Signifier such that it cannot be used at all, anymore, in any context.

Signifiers in the unconscious can recombine/dissolve with one another.

Signifiers can be repressed, but not affects. Once the Signifier is repressed, the affect is orphaned and will attach to other Signifiers. This is [[Freud's theory of Displacement]].
