> Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.
> -- *James 1:19*

>If thou art painted by any external thing, it is not this thing that disturbs thee, but they own judgement about it... Remember that the ruling faculty is invincible, when self-collected it is satisfied with itself, if it does nothing which it does not choose to do, even if it resist from mere obstinacy.
>-- *Meditations 8.47-8.48*, Marcus Aurelius

Initial reactions are involuntary and must be tolerated. Considered thought and behavior ought to be the measure of a person's quality. Self-control in the moment, abstraction, and consideration are all desirable.
